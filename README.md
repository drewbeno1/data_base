## shows you trend analysis, is their strike % going up or down. This is the code for the app itself and some of the basic pandas data cleaning that goes in behind the scenes. 

# Takes three inputs and turns it into a wide array of stats and analysis
## You choose an excel file that is connected to sharepoint, then we have a Power BI dashboard connected to the sharepoint location that presents the data and runs the analytics
